1. User Identity Verification
Command used: whoami && groups
'whoami' shows the username and 'groups' shows all the groups I belong to.
refer screenshot file Q1 1 for verifying command and output on terminal

2. Workspace Validation
Command used: pwd && ls -la
'pwd' prints the current working directory and 'ls' '-la' lists all files/directories (including hidden ones) in long format with ownership, permissions, size, and timestamp.
refer screenshot file Q1 2 for verifying command and output on terminal

3. Environment Confirmation File
Created a file named user_info.txt and wrote the line "Linux user environment verified".
Command used: echo "Linux user environment verified" > user_info.txt to execute the above.
Command used: cat user_info.txt to display the text from the file on the terminal.
refer screenshot file Q1 3 for verifying command and output on terminal

4. File Integrity Check
Command used to display the number of characters present in user_info.txt is 'wc -m user_info.txt'
wc -m counts characters (including spaces and newline).
refer screenshot file Q1 4 for verifying command and output on terminal

5. Learning the tools [mkdir]
Command used to access the manual page of mkdir command: man mkdir
A useful option is -p. It creates parent directories as needed, and does not raise an error if the directory already exists. This allows creating nested directory structures with a single command.
I have used the command mkdir -p BITS/CLIS/SGA to create a BITS folder and CLIS sub folder in BITS and SGA subfolder in CLIS.
refer screenshot Q1 5a for the manual of mkdir and Q1 5b to see the commands used to create the folders

6. Home Directory Inspection
A simple command to alphabetically list the contents of the home directory is ls -la.
I have used ls -la ~ | sort -k9 to list the contents of the home directory and sort the list alphabetically by the 9th column which is the column for filenames.
refer screenshot Q1 6 for the list the contents of the home directory sorted in alphabetical order.

7. Log Investigation
Created a file named log.txt and entered the following words one below the other in the file: BITS, student, Command Line Interface and Scripting, admin, success.
Then I displayed the file contents to verify using the cat command followed by the file name
Then I searched for the word 'admin' inside the file log.txt and displayed only the matching line using the command: grep "admin" log.txt
refer screenshot Q1 7 for all the steps and output

8. System Information check
Used the command uname -r to show the linux kernel version currently running
used the command uname -a to show more detailed kernel information
refer screenshot Q1 8 for all the steps and output

9. Network Connectivity Test
Used command ping -c 1 www.google.com to send 1 ICMP request packet to www.google.com
This command tests both DNS resolution and network connectivity to the remote host.
refer screenshot Q1 9 for the command and its output.

10. System Health Awareness
Used the command 'uptime' to display system uptime.
The uptime command shows three key pieces of information in this order:
Current time – system clock time
Uptime duration – how long the system has been running since last boot
Number of logged-in users – count of users currently logged in
Load averages – three values representing system load over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes
refer screenshot Q1 10 for the command and its output.
